## Problem Statement
In this analysis of IPL matches from 2008 to 2017 is done using python packages like pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. This Exploratory Data Analysis will help us to find patterns in data, determining relationships in data. 

We will try to identify the team that has more chance to win the upcoming seasons by finding observations like success rate of each team, identify the team that has won maximum seasons, best defending and chasing team and analyse the toss decisions etc.

## Approach
Data Exploration : Exploring dataset using pandas, numpy.

Data visualization : Visualize data using matplotlib and seaborn.

Building web app : Building web app using python and streamlit.

User Interface & deployment :  Created an UI that shows the output.
                          After that I have deployed project on heroku.
## Technologies Used
 
   1. Python 
   2. Pandas
   3. Numpy
   4. Matplotlib
   5. Seaborn
   6. Steamlit
   7. Plotly

```
If pip is not already installed, Follow this [link](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

## Deployement on Heroku
Create a virtual app on Heroku website. You can either connect your github profile or download cli to manually deploy this project.
Follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.

## Bugs & Logs

1. If you find a bug, kindly open an issue and it will be addressed as early as possible.
2. Under localhost, logging is performed for all the actions and its stored onto logs.txt file
3. When the app is deployed on heroku, logs can be viewed on  heroku dashboard or CLI.
